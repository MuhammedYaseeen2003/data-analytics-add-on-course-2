## Meaning of research 

"A careful investigation or inquiry specially through search for new facts in any branch of knowledge"-- The Advanced Learners Dictionary.

## Objectives of research

- Uncover the truth which has not been discovered as yet.

- To get familiarity with a phenomenon

- To explore new facts

- To identify cause- effect relationship

## Research Approaches

1. Quantitative

    - inferential
    - experimental
    - simulation
    
2. Qualitative

    - subjective assessments 
    
## Research & scientific methods

### Types of propositions

1. Dogmas

2. Hypothesis

3. Universal Truth



## Steps in research process

"Research methodology is a way to systematically solve the research problem"

## Step-I: Formulating the research problem

Two types

    - relate to state of nature
    - relate to relationship between wariables

## Step-II Literature survey/ productive discussions

## Step-III Development of a hypothesis

" Commonsense is the chief requisite and logic is the chief teacher"

## Hypothesis- what people says!

"A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty. A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective."----Edward Teller(Hungarian-American physicist)

## Hypothesis- what theory says!

- Hypothesis originates from the Greek work hupo (under) and thesis (placing). It means an idea made from limited evidence. It is a starting point for further investigation.

- Hypothesis may be defined as a proposition or a set of proposition set forth as an explanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena either asserted merely as a provisional conjecture to guide some investigation or accepted as highly probable in the light of established facts.

## Characteristics of hypothesis in Research Methodology

- Hypothesis should be clear and precise. 

- Hypothesis should be capable of being tested.

- Hypothesis should state relationship between variables, if it happens to be a relational hypothesis.

- Hypothesis should be limited in scope and must be specific.

- Hypothesis should be stated as far as possible in most simple terms so that the same is easily understandable by all concerned.

- Hypothesis should be consistent with most known facts.

- Hypothesis should be amenable to testing within a reasonable time. 

- Hypothesis must explain the facts that gave rise to the need for explanation.


## Hypothesis- what we have to know!

- A hypothesis is a conjecture on its trial.

- Its existence is threatened by every relevant fact which it cannot explain and it is finally destroyed by one single "crucial instance" that refuses to illustrate it.

- Moreover it is liable at every moment to be supplanted by some simpler more fundamental or far-reaching hypothesis.

- An Einstein comes after our Newtons and at least startles the world. 

- The whole progress of science when it takes long strides illustrates this revolutionary kind of advance that comes from the substitution of one hypothesis for another.

##Step-IV: Preparing a research design

Research design is a conceptual structure/ frame work within which research would be conducted. It will be based on the research purpose. A meaningful classification is 

    - Exploration
    - Description
    - Diagonosis
    - Experimentation
    
## Step V: Determining sample design

Types of sample design

1. Probabilistic sampling

    - simple random sampling
    - systematic sampling
    - strtified sampling
    - cluster sampling
    
2. Non-probabilistic sampling

    - convenience sampling
    - judgement sampling
    - quota sampling

## Step-VI: Collecting the data

Through experiments or survey

    Stage I- Planning
    Stage II- Execution
    
     
##  Principles of Questionire Design

1. Sensitive to the study.

    - Confidentiality should be guaranteed.
    - Sidetracking should be avoided at all costs.
    - completion time stamp should be used.
    - Should clarify the usefulness of the study 
    - motivate the respontents to participate.
    - demographic information should be collected

2. Keep it Simple.

     - Should have a logical order
     - Neet layout
     - Well designed

3. Question designing

    - Ask one information at a time
    - Ask questions having specific answer
    - Ask appropriate, non-judgemental questions
    - Avoid suggestive questions
    - Use short questions
    - Avoid jargon, abbreviations or slang
    - Use mutually exclusive and exhaustive answer options

4. Types of questions

    - Closed-ended questions
        - Yes/no questions 
        - Multiple choice 
        - Scaled questions
    - Open-ended questions
        - Completely unstructured 
        - Word association 
        - Sentence completion 
        - Story completion 


5. Choose the Best Delivery ( data collection) Method.

    - Postal
    - Telephone
    - Electronic
    - Personally administered

6. Tackle biasedness.

7. Be Selective From the Start.

8. Pilot the Questionnaire.

## Step- VII: Data analysis

Data is not information!!!

"Data+ descriptive analysis= informations"



## Step- VIII: Hypothesis testing

"informations+ hypothesis testing= inference"

## Step- IX: Generalizations & Interpretations

" Real value of research lies in its ability to arrive at certain generalizations"

## Step-X: Report preparation

Structure of a thesis/ report

    - Front matter
        - title page
        - declaration
        - acknowledgements
        - table of contents
        - list of tables
        - list of figures
        - abbreviations
    - Main matter
        - introduction
        - literature review
        - methods
        - results and discussions
        - Conclusions       
    - Back matter
        - appendices
        - references
        - list of publications
        - index
    
## Productive tools in research

- SPSS- for ' primary analysis'

- R- for 'intelligent' analysis

- Word processors- for stenographic typesetting

- LaTeX for - scientific typesetting

- AI & ML tools for responsive analysis
